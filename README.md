### Go-To-Market Strategy (Copy the $2M Formula)

#### Week 1: Launch
- Post on HN: "I built an API that screens resumes in 2 seconds"
- Post on r/recruiting: "Tired of reading 500 resumes? I built something"
- Cold email 50 recruiting agencies with subject: "Screen 100 resumes in 2 minutes?"

#### Week 2: First Sales
- Offer "Pay only for what works" trial
- First 20 resumes free, then $0.50 each
- Target small recruiting firms (move fast, less bureaucracy)

#### Week 3: Scale
- Add Stripe billing
- Create Zapier integration
- Partner with 1 ATS system

### The Money Math

- 10 customers Ã— $199/month = $2,000 MRR
- 100 customers Ã— $199/month = $20,000 MRR  
- 500 customers Ã— $199/month = $100,000 MRR

**Key Insight**: Recruiting agencies process 1000s of resumes/month. You only need 0.1% market share to hit $1M ARR.

### Customer Acquisition Hack

**"The Trojan Horse"**: Build a free Chrome extension that extracts text from LinkedIn profiles and scores them. Upsell to the API for bulk processing.

### Why This Will Work

1. **Immediate ROI**: Recruiter time = $50-150/hour. You save them hours daily.
2. **No Behavior Change**: They already screen resumes, you just make it instant
3. **Sticky Revenue**: Once integrated into their workflow, they won't churn

### Next Features (After $10K MRR)

1. **Bulk Upload**: Process 1000 resumes at once
2. **ATS Integrations**: Direct plug-ins for Greenhouse, Lever, etc.
3. **Custom Scoring**: Let companies define their own criteria
4. **Diversity Insights**: Flag potential bias in requirements

Remember: Ship fast, charge early, iterate based on who pays.
